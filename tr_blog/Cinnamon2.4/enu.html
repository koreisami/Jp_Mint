<p>A brand new version of Cinnamon is out and it will be featured in the upcoming release of Linux Mint 17.1 at the end of the month.</p>
<p>For a quick look at its new features, please read the official announcement: <a href="http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2014/11/cinnamon-2-4/">Cinnamon 2.4</a></p>
<p>In the next two weeks we&#8217;ll be using your feedback to improve Cinnamon and to fix eventual bugs in preparation for the next Linux Mint release.</p>
<p>If you want to help beta-test the new desktop (beware: There will be bugs, there always are bugs in new releases, that&#8217;s why we leave a month between the releases of Cinnamon and Linux Mint), you can upgrade Cinnamon to version 2.4.0 by following the instructions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch Menu-&gt;Administration-&gt;&#8221;Software Sources&#8221;.</li>
<li>Tick the option &#8220;Unstable Packages (Romeo)&#8221;.</li>
<li>Carefully read the warning in the dialog that pops up and click &#8220;Yes&#8221; if appropriate.</li>
<li>Launch the Update Manager and click on &#8220;Refresh&#8221;.</li>
<li>If a new mintupdate version is shown, apply it.</li>
<li>Apply all updates related to Cinnamon (sort by version, 2.4.0 or 2.4.1, or by update type since they all come from Romeo).</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy, don&#8217;t take unnecessary risks (this will be all completely stable in less than a month) and don&#8217;t forget to send us your feedback <img src='http://blog.linuxmint.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
